# Sumer Market

## Overview

The second project at General Assembly Software Engineering Bootcamp is to build a Full-Stack CRUD App with at least one model with all 7 RESTful routes so I decided to build Sumer Market App. Sumer Market is an online grocery store. It gives customers the ability to purchase products as well as to view, create, edit, and delete recipe pages that they have shared with the rest of the community on the app. 

The purpose of the app is to solve the problem of anyone who cooks middle eastern cuisine and middle easterns living outside of the middle east and not able to find the products they are used to buy to cook their meals.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js, Mongoose, Express, JSX, HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap
- Visual Studio Code, MongoDB, and Heroku 

## Approach Taken
Using MVC (Models, Views, and Controllers) and MongoDB to store data, I create 7 RESTful routes for the products page for admin usage. Using the same technologies, I created a recipes page that has all 7 RESTful routes for user usage.

## Unsolve Problems
- Users can't actually buy any product - give the ability to purchase

## Future Development
- Create a functioning shopping cart
- User authentications and login/signup page
- Create about and contact us static pages
- Give the admin and user specific access
- Allow entry of recipe step by step images
- Give users the ability to view the app in Arabic
